Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan, an incoming Business Analytics Undergraduate at NUS!!
I have a strong passion in Data Science and Analytics and I'm currently working on upgrading my Data Science Skills and familiarising with the new libraries.
I'm focussed in learning the intuition behind ANNs and how to build them. Currently progressing towards learning Advanced Deep Learning!
You can check out my linkedin if you would like to collaborate with me on Data Science projects to learn from each other!
